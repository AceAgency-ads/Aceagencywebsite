<objective>
Validate ReactBits components for RSC compatibility, configure Unsplash image optimization, and verify the responsive design system works across all target viewport widths.

Purpose: ReactBits RSC compatibility is the biggest unknown in Phase 1 (flagged as a concern in STATE.md). This plan resolves that risk early. Additionally, responsive image handling and the mobile-first design system must be proven before any marketing pages are built in Phase 3.

Output: At least 3 working ReactBits components, a responsive page with an Unsplash image in WebP format, and a verified design system spanning 320px to 2560px.

  <name>Task 1: Validate ReactBits components for RSC and integrate Unsplash responsive images</name>

    src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
    src/app/globals.css

    **Part A: ReactBits Component Validation**

    1. Visit the ReactBits website (https://www.reactbits.dev/) or use the ReactBits MCP server to browse available components. Select at least 3 components that are useful for a B2B marketing website. Good candidates:
       - **Text/Typography animation** (e.g., SplitText, TextReveal, GradientText) -- for hero sections
       - **Button/CTA component** (e.g., ShinyButton, MagneticButton, SpotlightButton) -- for call-to-action elements
       - **Card/Container** (e.g., TiltCard, GlassCard, SpotlightCard) -- for service/portfolio cards
       - **Background/Decoration** (e.g., Aurora, Particles, GridPattern) -- for section backgrounds
       - **Scroll animation** (e.g., FadeIn, SlideIn, CountUp) -- for stats/testimonial sections

    2. For each selected component:
       a. Copy the component source code from ReactBits into `src/components/ui/{component-name}.tsx`
       b. Add `"use client"` directive at the top of the file (ReactBits components almost certainly use hooks/browser APIs)
       c. Install any peer dependencies the component requires (e.g., framer-motion, gsap, @react-spring/web)
       d. Test that the component renders without errors in the Next.js dev server
       e. Test that `npm run build` succeeds with the component included

    3. If a component fails (errors in build or runtime):
       - Document the error
       - Try wrapping in a client component boundary
       - If still fails, replace with a different ReactBits component
       - If >50% of components fail, note this and suggest the Radix UI + Framer Motion fallback in the SUMMARY

    4. Create a wrapper/index file at `src/components/ui/index.ts` that re-exports all validated components for easy importing.

    **Part B: Unsplash Image Integration**

    5. Update `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` to include:
       - At least one Unsplash image using `next/image` with `fill` mode and `sizes` prop for responsive sizing
       - Choose an image that fits the B2B professional aesthetic (office workspace, team collaboration, digital marketing, etc.)
       - Use the `sizes` prop correctly: `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"` (adjust based on actual layout)
       - Do NOT use the deprecated `priority` prop -- use `preload` if the image is above the fold (LCP candidate)
       - Verify the image serves in WebP/AVIF format by checking Network tab in DevTools

    Example:
    ```tsx
    import Image from 'next/image'

    // In the hero section:
    <section className="relative w-full h-[60vh] md:h-[80vh] overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
      <Image
        src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557804506-669a67965ba0?w=1920&q=80"
        alt="Modern digital marketing workspace"
        fill
        sizes="100vw"
        className="object-cover"
        preload
      />
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-brand-black/60 to-transparent" />
      <div className="relative z-10 flex items-center h-full p-8 md:p-16">
        <h1 className="font-headline text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white">
          {t('title')}
        </h1>
      </div>
    </section>
    ```

    **Part C: Responsive Design Verification**

    6. Update the homepage to use responsive Tailwind classes that demonstrate the mobile-first design system:
       - Use `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` patterns for card layouts
       - Use responsive text sizing: `text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-6xl`
       - Use responsive padding: `p-4 md:p-8 lg:p-16`
       - Use responsive max-width containers: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
       - Ensure the page has NO horizontal scrollbar at any viewport width from 320px to 2560px

    7. Add any additional spacing/layout design tokens to `src/app/globals.css` if needed (e.g., container max-width, section spacing). Keep these minimal -- Tailwind defaults are good for most use cases.

    8. Integrate the validated ReactBits components into the homepage to demonstrate they work alongside the brand design system and i18n translations. Each component should use brand colors/fonts where applicable.

  <verify>
    1. `npm run dev` starts without errors.
    2. Visit `/ro` -- ReactBits components render and are interactive (animations play, hover effects work).
    3. Visit `/en` -- same components work with English content.
    4. Open DevTools > Network tab -- the Unsplash image request shows `content-type: image/webp` (or image/avif).
    5. Resize browser from 320px to 2560px -- layout adapts smoothly, no horizontal scrollbar, no content overflow.
    6. Check specific breakpoints: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1440px (large), 2560px (ultra-wide).
    7. `npm run build` succeeds with all ReactBits components included.
    8. View Source -- page content is server-rendered (translations in HTML), ReactBits client components hydrate without errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    At least 3 ReactBits components validated and rendering in the Next.js project. Each wrapped with "use client" for RSC compatibility. Unsplash image renders in WebP format via next/image. Page layout is responsive from 320px to 2560px with no overflow. All components use brand colors and fonts.

    This is a human verification checkpoint. Claude has completed all automated work for Phase 1. The user now needs to visually verify the complete foundation before Phase 1 is marked complete.

    Complete Phase 1 foundation includes:
    - Brand design system (6 colors, 4 fonts)
    - Bilingual routing (/ro and /en with server-rendered translations)
    - Language switcher preserving page path
    - Hreflang tags in HTML head
    - At least 3 ReactBits components
    - Responsive Unsplash image in WebP
    - Mobile-first responsive layout (320px-2560px)
  </action>
  <verify>
    User performs the following verification steps:

    1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
    2. Visit http://localhost:3000/ro
       - Verify Romanian content renders ("Transformam afacerea ta...")
       - Verify brand colors display correctly (violet, burgundy, mint, blue, black, grey)
       - Verify fonts render (4 different font families visible)
       - Verify ReactBits components are interactive (hover, click, animate)
       - Verify Unsplash image loads (not broken/placeholder)
    3. Click "EN" language switcher
       - Verify URL changes to /en
       - Verify content switches to English
       - Verify page path is preserved
    4. Right-click > View Source on /ro page
       - Verify Romanian text is in the raw HTML (server-rendered)
       - Search for "hreflang" -- should find links for ro, en, x-default
    5. Resize browser window to 320px width
       - Verify no horizontal scrollbar
       - Verify layout stacks vertically
       - Verify text is readable
    6. Resize browser to 2560px width
       - Verify content is centered/constrained (not stretching edge to edge)
       - Verify layout uses available space appropriately
    7. Open DevTools > Network tab, reload page
       - Find the Unsplash image request
       - Verify content-type is image/webp or image/avif
  </verify>
  <done>
    User types "approved" to complete Phase 1, or describes any issues to fix. All 5 Phase 1 success criteria are visually confirmed.
  </done>
